# Competitive Programming - Contribution Sprint

**CP & Debugging Challenge**

This repository contains **three medium-level programming tasks** designed to assess logical thinking, problem-solving ability, and basic debugging skills. Participants may use any programming language of their choice.

The objective is to fork this repository, complete the tasks, upload the solutions in the specified format, and submit the link to the fork within the submission deadline.

# What should you do?

1. **Fork the Repository** - Select the Fork option at the top-right corner of this page.
2. **Solve the Tasks** - You may use any programming language. Inside your fork, create the following folder: **solutions/your-name/**
3. **Add your solution files as:** task1.extension, task2.extension task3.extension as in `task1.py`, `task2.cpp`, `task3.java`. 
4. **Submit Your Fork** - After uploading all three solutions, push the changes to your fork and submit the fork link through the provided submission form.
5. Pull requests are not required.

# Task Summary

### **Task 1 - Dynamic Programming**
**House Robber Problem**  
You are given a list representing the amount of money in each house.  
You must compute the **maximum amount** that can be robbed without robbing two adjacent houses.

This task requires understanding of dynamic programming and optimal substructure.

### **Task 2 - Algorithm Implementation**
**Predicting the Winning Party (Dota2 Senate)**  
You are given a string representing senators from two parties.  
Each senator can ban opponents or declare victory when only one party remains active.

Your task is to simulate the round-based voting process and determine which party wins, assuming optimal decisions.

---

### **Task 3 - Debugging Challenge**
**Count Elements Greater Than the Median**  
You are given **buggy Python code** intended to compute how many elements in a list are strictly greater than the median.

# Notes
1. Ensure code readability and correct file placement.
2. Follow the folder structure precisely.
3. Submit the fork link before the deadline.
